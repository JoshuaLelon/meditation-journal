Goal: Meditate for 20 minutes, focusing only on breath (trying to "become" breath). No counting or anything.

In previous 15 minute counting attempts, I noticed that two postural obstacles that kept popping up were:
- a pinch in my lower spine
- a pull in my right shoulder

I don't know if it completely fixed both, but doing 2 stretches for each one helped tremendously.
They didn't pop up as thoughts as often.

The 20 minute meditation goal itself did make me run into a new problem: fear.

I told myself I could do 5 minutes easily. 10 minutes would be harder but no big deal.

Once I did 10 minutes consistently, 15 minutes was harder but still not too big of a deal.

Now that I've just done 20, the entire time I had thoughts like "wow this is a long time I wanna get out"

I kept trying to refocus to my breath but I'd lose out a lot more to that thought.

Also, I keep thinking about whether my back is completely straight or not. If it isn't I should fix it,
so I benefit from the habit sooner than later. Being perfectly elongated feels uncomfortable - do I get used to it?
Having my spine in more of an S shape feels more comfortable, but I feel like I'm hunched over a little bit too much.
However, that's what's comfortable. But then again, that could be because I'm used to sitting like that from computers.

I'm not sure..
