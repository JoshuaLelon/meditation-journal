Goals:

- whatever happens, simply experience it (there are no bad meditations)
- observe clearly neutral experience which you might prefer to ignore as uninteresting
- ignore all streams of urges for at least 1 minutes (e.g. to scratch, fidget, etc.)
- maintain a general light background bodily awareness
- meditate for 15 mins

To keep in mind:

- the need to lead and follow thoughts is itself a habit – an addiction. A vast creative space appears
when thinking becomes a choice rather than compulsion

- we wrongly suppose that meditation is boring because there is nothing to do. It is, in fact, only
boring when we stuff boring thoughts into the emptiness. If you can face emptiness squarely 
and stare into it – you will not find boredom there. When you break through the self-imposed 
barrier of boredom—the terror of nothing happening—you discover the vast brilliant space of 
unlimited creative potential. If you are fully present in your attention – experience is never boring.

Thoughts:

At first, setting the condition that I'll only let myself satisfy the urge after 1 minute elapsed made it worse – I suddenly felt all sorts of itches and tingles and discomforts that all seemed to whisper at me at once. I half gave up, and moved around some. Some of them I more consciously blew off, but others I didn't even notice that I moved until after I did it, and then thought “darn, wasn't supposed to do that.”

It got better though. After a little bit of chaos I thought “well, there's no bad meditations, so let's just keep trying.” I made myself really try and focus on counting, almost like I kept “refreshing” my focus (like refreshing a webpage) every 0.2 seconds or so. Sometimes my brain just gave up and I forgot about the discomforts for a little bit. I noticed that the more I resolve to focus, the quicker my brain gives up.

I had several thoughts about boringness. I thought a few times, “yeah wow this is boring” but I tried to cull that thought and focus on my breathing when I noticed I was having it because I didn't want to negatively spiral. It did make me think – where the heck do those thoughts come from? I'm OK at shifting back to breathing once I notice I'm having a thought, but I wish I could figure out how to just not have them. Is that even possible? It seems like the closest I get is the “constant refreshing” thing I mentioned earlier – if I do that then I don't have the spare brain power to have extraneous thoughts.

There were also times that I was pretty present, and I could feel what I think was myself about to get distracted or have another thought, and I made myself “more present” to try and stop myself from having the thought. I think it worked, because I didn't have a thought – but I'm not sure if I would have had one in the first place.
