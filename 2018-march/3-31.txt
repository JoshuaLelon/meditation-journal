Goals:

- whatever happens, simply experience it (there are no bad meditations)
- observe clearly neutral experience which you might prefer to ignore as uninteresting
- ignore all streams of urges for at least 1 minutes (e.g. to scratch, fidget, etc.)
- maintain a general light background bodily awareness
- meditate for 15 mins

To keep in mind:

- the need to lead and follow thoughts is itself a habit – an addiction. A vast creative space appears
when thinking becomes a choice rather than compulsion

- we wrongly suppose that meditation is boring because there is nothing to do. It is, in fact, only
boring when we stuff boring thoughts into the emptiness. If you can face emptiness squarely 
and stare into it – you will not find boredom there. When you break through the self-imposed 
barrier of boredom—the terror of nothing happening—you discover the vast brilliant space of 
unlimited creative potential. If you are fully present in your attention – experience is never boring.
